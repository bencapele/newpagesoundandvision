                            <p> He uses this action in order to "lose himself" in nature and then makes an "arrangement" through an installation of which he then makes a photographic observation. Nils Udo uses different techniques: photography, drawing, painting,
                                installation, sculpture with natural elements. Mixing ephemeral sculpture, precarious installation and large format photography, Nils-Udo’s works are produced in and with nature. Weathering and natural decay are an integral
                                part of his creative process.

                            <p>This technique allows him to develop new images and to reach the subconscious layers of the mind. Intuitive drawing is derived from the literary roots of surrealism and its automatic writing, which requires that the consciousness
                                be completely extinguished while writing a text. This literary form has in turn influenced the content of many works by Surrealist artists and often results in meanders and flowing forms.

                                <p> One of his works, an oil painting of the Brooklyn Bridge, was chosen for display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. But music had more of an impact on Sekou, especially the music of James Brown. Sekou and two of his brothers
                                    started a dance review with the group name the Black Executives and began entering local talent contests. By the age of 14, with an upcoming career as a dancer and commercial artist, Sekou realized his destiny as a
                                    musician and started playing the electric bass. At age 17, Sekou teamed up with GRP artist, Tom Browne and he recorded on Browne's album “Funkin for Jamaica.“ Sekou would later move to Los Angeles where he met the late
                                    George Howard, who he toured and recorded a host of records with. Sekou then collaborated with producers Angela Winbush and Ronald Isley to record on Stephanie Mills’ hit “Something In The Way You Make Me Feel.” Sekou
                                    was later hired as musical director for the Isley Brothers where he served with distinction for 11 years. Sekou is also a member of Quincy Jones’ “A Team” along with session musicians such as John "JR" Robinson, Greg
                                    Phillinganes and Paul Jackson, Jr.</p>

                                <p> While he studied interaction design, the self-taught artist has focused on visual arts and illustration for the past twelve years, drawing inspiration from graphic design sensibilities and op-art minimalism. His bold and
                                    vibrant work is a playful interpretation of minimalism particularly focusing on depth and dimension through pattern and repetition. His professional career has seen him based in Tokyo, New York, Malmö, Amsterdam, Sydney
                                    and Melbourne. Select clients he has worked with include Instagram, IBM, Apple, Air Bnb, Nike and the band OK Go.
